# Automated Liquidity Manager (ALM) - Rowship Technical Challenge

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements an **Automated Liquidity Manager (ALM)** for a stablecoin pool that automatically maintains liquidity in ultra-concentrated ranges, maximizing fee capture through intelligent rebalancing.

### 🎯 Core Strategy
**"Ultra-concentrated liquidity management"** - Liquidity is maintained in very narrow 3-tick ranges around the current pool price, automatically rebalancing when the price moves outside the active range.

## 🧩 Components Implemented

### 1. Smart Contracts
- **FakeUSDC.sol** - Simulated ERC20 token (6 decimals)
- **FakeSCUSD.sol** - Simulated ERC20 token (18 decimals)
- **MockPool.sol** - Simplified Uniswap V3 pool implementation for testing
- **ALMManager.sol** - Main ALM contract with rebalancing logic

### 2. Automated Executor (TypeScript)
- **PoolMonitor** - Real-time pool monitoring
- **ALMExecutor** - Executes rebalancing when needed
- **MetricsCollector** - Performance metrics collection and analysis

### 3. Frontend (React)
- **Real-time Dashboard** with ALM metrics
- **Position Visualization** current and historical
- **Transaction History** of rebalancing operations
- **System Status** monitoring

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Setup and Run

1. **Install dependencies and start Hardhat node:**
```bash
npm install
npx hardhat node
```

2. **Deploy contracts (in new terminal):**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-all.ts --network localhost
```

3. **Start the executor (in new terminal):**
```bash
cd executor
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. **Start the frontend (in new terminal):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

5. **Run simulation for demo:**
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/realistic-simulation.ts --network localhost
```

### Deployed Contracts (Local Testnet)
The deployment script will output contract addresses that are automatically configured for the frontend and executor.

## 📊 Key Features

### Ultra-Concentrated Strategy
- **3-tick ranges** for maximum capital efficiency
- **Automatic rebalancing** when price moves outside range
- **Real-time monitoring** and execution

### Risk Management
- **Emergency pause** functionality
- **Owner-only critical functions**
- **Graceful error handling** with try-catch blocks
- **Slippage protection**

### Performance Tracking
- **TVL monitoring** across tokens
- **APY calculations** based on fee generation
- **Rebalance success rate** tracking
- **Real-time position status**

## 🛠️ Development Commands

### Smart Contracts
```bash
# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to local network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-all.ts --network localhost

# Run simulation
npx hardhat run scripts/realistic-simulation.ts --network localhost
```

### Executor Service
```bash
cd executor
npm run dev     # Development mode with hot reload
npm run build   # Build for production
npm start       # Run built version
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev     # Development server on port 5173
npm run build   # Build for production
npm run preview # Preview production build
```

## 📈 System Metrics

### Core Metrics Displayed
1. **Total Value Locked (TVL)** - Combined USDC/SCUSD liquidity
2. **Annual Percentage Yield (APY)** - Estimated returns based on fee collection
3. **Total Rebalances** - Number of successful position adjustments
4. **Position Status** - Current range and in/out of range indicator
5. **Recent Activity** - Transaction history with timestamps

### Performance Indicators
- **Success Rate** - Percentage of successful rebalancing operations
- **Average Response Time** - Time from trigger to execution
- **Gas Efficiency** - Cost optimization metrics

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### Demo Limitations
- **Simplified fee calculation** - For demonstration purposes
